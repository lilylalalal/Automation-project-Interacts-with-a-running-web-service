	<h4>Great Customer Service</h4>
	<h5>John - Dec. 21, 2017</h5>
	<p>The customer service here is very good. They helped me find a 2017 Camry with good condition in reasonable price. Campared to other dealers, they provided the lowest price. Definttely recommend!</p>

	<h4>Best experience so far</h4>
	<h5>Katie - Dec. 9, 2019</h5>
	<p>My friend recommended this place and  I decided to give a try. I called them beforehand and made sure they have the models I was looking for. They evenly sent me a bunch of photos and specs of the car I was looking for. One the day I visited, the sales person John helped me with test drive and showed me what I should be aware of when buying a used car. I felt like I learned a lot. They made the process so smooth that I saved a lot of time. It&#x27;s the best car purchasing experience I had so far!</p>

	<h4>Waste of my time</h4>
	<h5>Anonymous - Sept. 21, 2018</h5>
	<p>I came in around 6pm and they seemed about to close the store. One of the sales seemed not being patient with me and made me feel like I have to either buy a car or come back later. Of course I didn&#x27;t buy a car there. Hopefully they can treat every customer with more patience.</p>

	<h4>Good deal for a 2015 RAV4</h4>
	<h5>Anonymous - April 17, 2018</h5>
	<p>Called them to look for a second-hand RAV4 and they are very nice and patience to help me find me a few matches then scheduled an appointmet with me. Came in and they had everything ready for me. I was surprised how professional those sales are and they explained and answered all my questions. Ended up buying the car and been using it for more than a month now. Everything looks good!</p>

	<h4>You will find what you want here</h4>
	<h5>Tom - June 5, 2019</h5>
	<p>I&#x27;ve being look around for a second handed Lexus RX for my family and this store happened to have a few of those. The experience was similar to most car dealers. The one I ended up buying has good condition and low mileage. I am pretty satisfied with the price they offered.</p>
